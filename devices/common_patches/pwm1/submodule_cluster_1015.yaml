# The PWM submodules may be represented as a cluster, rather that
# individually named registers.
#
# This file is nearly equivalent to submodule_cluster.yaml, but has
# "PWM" as the peripheral name, instead of PWM1. We rename the peripheral
# on the 1015 for consistency with other chip PWM peripheral names.
